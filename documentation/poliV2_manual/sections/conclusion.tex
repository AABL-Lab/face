\chapter{Troubleshooting}\label{ch:troubleshooting}

\section{Acceptable errors}

\subsection{Base}
\subsubsection{Hector Pose Estimation}
\texttt{Skipping XML Document /opt/ros/kinetic/share/\\
hector\_pose\_estimation/hector\_pose\_estimation\_nodelets.xml which had no Root Element.  This likely means the XML is malformed or missing.} \\

This will show when launching the base. We don't use hector pose estimation, so this does not affect anything.

\subsection{Arduino}
\subsubsection{Lost connection}
\texttt{Lost sync with device, restarting...} \\

This shows up periodically, for a yet-to-be-determined reason. It does not seem to negatively affect input/output from the arduino(s).

\section{Connectivity and Hardware Issues}
\subsection{Dynamixel driver / pan\_controller driver crashes}
Previously this was USB devices and udev rule issue. 
This now looks to be an issue with the controller driver itself. \\
There is a github issue open: \href{https://github.com/si-machines/poli2/issues/40}{https://github.com/si-machines/poli2/issues/40}


\subsection{TF tree broken / no laser scans output in RViz / localization fails}
Exact error: `No laser scan received (and thus no pose updates have been published) ' \\

Whats wrong: The scan merger node was launched before the lidar drivers were fully up, or it wasn't launched at all. Running \texttt{rosrun poli\_launch scan\_merger.launch} in a separate terminal solves this.


\section{Issues with existing code bases}

More specific issues that arise coming from other packages or libraries should be opened as issues on the respective issue tracker. \\

Issues or additions to the PoliV2 repository should be opened as a ticket at \href{https://github.com/si-machines/poli2/issues}{https://github.com/si-machines/poli2/issues} or as a Pull Request.
